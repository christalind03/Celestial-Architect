## Motivation
As an avid **Honkai: Star Rail** player, I wanted to tackle the challenge of building every character I own. However, because I own so many characters (approximately 90% of the available characters at the time of writing this), it became hard to keep track of what relic sets and light cones are optimal for each character. Furthermore, as new patches are released, new relics fitting specific character niches emerge, making it even more difficult to keep track of optimal builds. **Celestial Architect** simplifies this process, allowing players to focus on building their characters effectively.
